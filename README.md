Introduction
 For this project, the goal was to design a professional and visually engaging cover for "Save the Earth" magazine, using minimalist design principles to convey the message of environmental conservation.
 The design aimed to combine strong imagery, clean typography, and thoughtful layout to create a striking and impactful visual.

Techniques Used
High-Resolution Environmental Photography: A central, high-quality image of nature, such as a lush forest, pristine ocean, or endangered wildlife, was selected to highlight the magazine's focus on environmental awareness.
Typography: Bold, modern fonts were chosen for titles and text to ensure readability while maintaining a clean, contemporary aesthetic.
Layer Masking and Texture Effects: A paper texture or natural effect (e.g., leaf edges or crumpled paper) was used creatively to enhance the visual appeal and connect with the theme of sustainability.
Color Adjustments and Contrast: Brightness, contrast, and color balance were fine-tuned to ensure the image's natural beauty stands out while making the text easy to read.
Alignment and Spacing: Careful attention was paid to the layout, ensuring a balanced structure that guides the viewer's eye across the design.
Operating System Compatibility
This project was completed using Adobe Photoshop, which is compatible across multiple operating systems:

Windows: Supported on Windows 10 and above, suitable for both professional and home use.
macOS: Available on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later versions, providing robust design tools for Mac users.
